    <h2>David Zucca <span class="years">1963–2006</span></h2>
    <p>
      David Zucca was a Canadian artist whose work combined classical technique with deep emotional resonance.
      Trained at the Ontario College of Art and Humber College, he refined his skills in Florence, Italy,
      and painted extensively through the 1980s and early 2000s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zucca’s work was exhibited and sold across Canada, the U.S., and Europe. Whether painting stone doorways,
      abstract scenes, or intimate portraits, he captured a quiet, contemplative beauty that endures beyond his years.
