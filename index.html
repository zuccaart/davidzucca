    <p>
      David Zucca (b. 1951 â€“ d. 2020) was a Canadian painter whose work captured the quiet dignity of architecture,
      objects, and memory. A lifelong observer of light and texture, his work reflects the influence of classical techniques,
      modern realism, and a love of craftsmanship.
